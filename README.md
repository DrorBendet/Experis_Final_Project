# Experis_Final_Project
Final project at DS in Experis Academy

## The project's instruction:
Image inpainting reconstructs images in which some areas are missing - for example, due to damage over time.

The images are in grayscale and the missing parts are black, while there are no other black pixels in the image.


## Things that can improve the results:
1. Take buffer from the missing pixels (e.g. 3 pixels more from any direction)
2. Check from the diagonals.
3. Learn on the all set of images (or more)
